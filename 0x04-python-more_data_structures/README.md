# Python Programming: 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## General

Python is an exceptional programming language renowned for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries. With applications spanning from web development to data analysis, Python continues to empower developers to create elegant and efficient solutions.

## Sets

Sets in Python offer a remarkable way to manage collections of unique elements. You can form a set using either curly braces or the `set()` constructor. These structures excel at storing distinct items and executing various set operations.

### Common Set Methods

- `add(element)`: Integrate an element into the set.
- `remove(element)`: Extract a specified element from the set.
- `discard(element)`: Remove an element if it exists within the set.
- `union(other_set)`: Form a new set with elements from both sets.
- `intersection(other_set)`: Craft a new set with elements common to both sets.
- `difference(other_set)`: Deliver elements residing in the set but absent in the other set.
- `issubset(other_set)`: Ascertain whether a set serves as a subset of another.

## Sets vs Lists

When prioritizing uniqueness and necessitating set operations, opt for sets. Lists, on the other hand, accommodate duplicates and uphold a specific order.

## Iterating over a Set

Harness the power of a `for` loop to seamlessly traverse the elements within a set.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries present a dynamic array of key-value pairs, a quintessential feature of Python. Curly braces house these pairs, with each entry constructed as `key: value`. This versatile data structure proves invaluable in establishing relationships between data points.

### When to Use Dictionaries

Dictionaries emerge as the optimal choice when confronted with the challenge of storing data tethered to meaningful keys. They expedite swift lookups rooted in these keys.

### Key in a Dictionary

Key identifiers are sacrosanct within dictionaries, enabling access to associated values. These keys, often strings or numbers, must remain immutable.

## Iterating over a Dictionary

Navigate through a dictionary's terrain by iterating over its keys, values, or both, deploying the mighty `for` loop.

## Lambda Function

Meet the lambda function, a clandestine and succinct entity introduced via the `lambda` keyword. Ideal for concise operations, lambda functions remain a powerful asset in a programmer's toolkit.

## Map, Reduce, and Filter Functions

- `map(function, iterable)`: Apply a designated function to each member of the iterable.
- `filter(function, iterable)`: Return elements from the iterable that fulfill the stipulated function's criteria.
- `reduce(function, iterable)`: Engage in a cascading computation, imbuing the iterable's elements with transformative powers.
